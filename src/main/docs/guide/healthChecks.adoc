When the `elasticsearch` module is activated a api:configuration.elasticsearch.health.ElasticsearchHealthIndicator[] is
activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/health/CurrentHealthStatus.html[CurrentHealthStatus]
interface resolving the health of the Elasticsearch cluster.

The only configuration option supported is to enable or disable the indicator by the `endpoints.health.elasticsearch.enabled` key.

See the section on the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] for more information.
